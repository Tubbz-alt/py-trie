Unreleased
----------

- Pruning Bugfix: with duplicate values at multiple keys, pruning would sometimes incorrectly
  prune out a node that was still required. This is fixed for fresh databases, and unfixable
  for existing databases. (Prune is not designed for on-disk/existing DBs anyhow)
  https://github.com/ethereum/py-trie/pull/93
- Avoid reading root node when unnecessary during squash_changes(). This can be important when
  building a witness, if the witness is supposed to be empty. (for example, in storage tries)
  https://github.com/ethereum/py-trie/pull/101

1.4.0
----------

Released 2019-04-24

- Python 3.7 support
  https://github.com/ethereum/py-trie/pull/73
- Several proof (aka witness) updates
  - Added HexaryTrie.get_proof for proving a key exists https://github.com/ethereum/py-trie/pull/80
  - Prove a key is missing with get_proof https://github.com/ethereum/py-trie/pull/91
  - Bugfix getting a key from a proof with short nodes https://github.com/ethereum/py-trie/pull/82
- Raise MissingTrieNode with extra info, when an expected trie node is missing from the database
  (includes update so that pruning old nodes waits until set/delete succeeds)
  https://github.com/ethereum/py-trie/pull/83
  https://github.com/ethereum/py-trie/pull/86 (minor cleanup of 83)
  https://github.com/ethereum/py-trie/pull/90 (squash_changes() support for missing nodes)
- New `with trie.at_root(hash) as snapshot:` API, to read trie at a different root hash
  https://github.com/ethereum/py-trie/pull/84
- EXPERIMENTAL Sparse Merkle Trie in trie.smt (unstable API: could change at minor version)
